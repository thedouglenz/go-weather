# Go Weather

A Go weather program that uses OpenWeatherMaps JSON API

## Compiling with gb

I recommend using `gb` to compile this project as it is a great alternative build tool that is project based, doesn't care about `$GOPATH`

Instructions for installing `gb` are at https://getgb.io/docs/install/

1. `gb build`
